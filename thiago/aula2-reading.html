    <h2>📚 The Commission – Sell or Be Sold (Part 1)</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking of commissions: Every time you get your way, you’ve just been paid a commission. Not all payments are monetary. Some of the greatest achievements I’ve had in my life had nothing to do with money. Recognition for a job well done is a commission. A raise or a promotion at work is a commission. Gaining new friends is an incredible commission. Getting votes for a project you’re pushing forward is a commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find it comical when people tell me, “I could never be a salesperson because I could never work on commission.” I’m like, “What do you mean? Your entire life is a commission. There’s no salary guaranteed in life. The whole world is on commission and the whole world is required to sell!”
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s been said that the best things in life are free, but I don’t agree with that. The best things in life are those that come in the form of a commission for some extra, well-done effort! Happiness, security, safety, a great home, a great family, love, confidence, friends, your church, your community, and on and on—are all commissions for someone’s hard work at selling others on a better way of life.
