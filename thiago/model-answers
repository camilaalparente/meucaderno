  <h1>üó£Ô∏è Model Answers for Debate Questions</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Do you agree that selling is a prerequisite for life? Why or why not?</h2>
    <p><strong>Resposta modelo:</strong><br>
    Yes, I agree. In my opinion, we are always selling something ‚Äî even if it's not a product. Sometimes we sell ideas, opinions, or even our personality to make connections. Selling is not only about business; it's about communication and survival.</p>
    <p><strong>Chunks √∫teis:</strong><br>
    In my opinion...<br>
    It's not only about X; it's about Y.<br>
    We are always selling something, even if we don't realize it.</p>

    <h2>2. Have you ever had to sell an idea to someone? What happened?</h2>
    <p><strong>Resposta modelo:</strong><br>
    Yes, I had to convince my students‚Äô parents that learning slowly was more effective for their children. At first, they didn‚Äôt understand, but when I explained it clearly and gave examples, they agreed. I think that was a kind of selling.</p>

    <h2>3. What‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúselling‚Äù and ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù?</h2>
    <p><strong>Resposta modelo:</strong><br>
    That‚Äôs a good question. I think ‚Äúselling‚Äù is more intentional and structured, while ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù can be more emotional or spontaneous. Selling often includes a strategy or a goal, but both involve changing someone‚Äôs mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Chunks √∫teis:</strong><br>
    That's a good question.<br>
    Selling is more about strategy; convincing is more about emotion.<br>
    Both are about influence.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Why do you think most people don‚Äôt like the idea of ‚Äúsales‚Äù?</h2>
    <p><strong>Resposta modelo:</strong><br>
    Because many people think of sales as manipulation or pressure. They imagine a pushy person trying to make them buy something they don‚Äôt need. But in reality, selling can be about helping, solving problems, and creating value.</p>

    <h2>5. Do you agree that we are always trying to influence something?</h2>
    <p><strong>Resposta modelo:</strong><br>
    Yes, I do. Every day we try to influence others ‚Äî even with small things, like choosing a restaurant or asking for help. Even body language can influence people. So yes, we‚Äôre always influencing in some way.</p>
    <p><strong>Chunks √∫teis:</strong><br>
    Yes, I do.<br>
    Even small actions are forms of influence.<br>
    We influence more than we realize.</p>
