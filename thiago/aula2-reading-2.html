  <h1>📖 The Commission – Part II</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      True love, the ultimate commission, is earned by those who find the right partner, take care of him or her, continue to create the relationship, and keep it growing. There’s no guarantee that a relationship will get you love. First, you’ve got to <strong>persuade</strong> the person to take an interest in you. Then you have to find out what they want and what makes them happy. Then you have to produce it and keep producing it. But <strong>somewhere along the line</strong>, you have to the other person on the idea that you’re the one that he or she can trust to create a life with. If you succeed and <strong>exceed</strong> the person’s expectations, you will get the commission of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health is not guaranteed in life. Health is a commission for taking care of yourself and your mind. When a person successfully sells himself on eating right, working out, and taking care of his attitude, he gets a commission of having good health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great benefit of children is also a commission of <strong>sorts</strong> and is not guaranteed to every marriage. You still have to <strong>convince</strong> your partner to have sex with you, and even marriage doesn’t guarantee you sex. If you can’t <strong>close</strong> your partner on wanting to have sex with you, then you won’t get the great commission of children. Once you have the kids, you have to continue to. Concepts such as <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>work ethic</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, <strong>good manners</strong>, and <strong>homework</strong> all have to be sold. If you don’t do the selling, they will sell you. Kids are the best salespeople on the planet. They’re <strong>passionate</strong>, <strong>relentless</strong>, and persistent <strong>closers</strong>, able to <strong>break down</strong> their parents’ <strong>resistance</strong> until they get what they want!
